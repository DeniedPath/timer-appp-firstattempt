## 🔍 Research Findings

Our research identified several key insights that informed the application design:

### User Needs
* Users prefer visual reinforcement of progress
* Achievement systems significantly increase engagement
* Aesthetic experience affects focus quality
* Customization options are highly valued
* Breathing exercises enhance focus and reduce stress

### Technical Considerations
* Timer accuracy requires special handling across browsers
* Background operation needs careful implementation
